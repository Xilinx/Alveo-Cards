# GTF RAW Unynchronized Latency Measurement Design: Simulation

## Running the Simulation
To run a simulation of the design, follow the instructions detailed [here](../../../../Docs/simulating_a_design.md).

## Simulation Behavior
The following waveform shows the simulation behavior of the GTF latency measurement design in RAW mode. The markers are placed on the same set of data. Compensated for the alignment and pattern detection logic, a latency of five clock cycles can be observed.
