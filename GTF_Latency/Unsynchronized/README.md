# GTF Latency Unsynchronized Design
## Description
These designs demonstrates the GTF latency operating in MAC and RAW mode with GTF in internal near-end loopback.  Both TXUSRCLK and RXUSRCLK are at the same frequency, but with random phase difference.

The following links provide additional design details, including simulation and VIO support.
