# Loading a Reference Design Vivado Project

## Overview

Details how to create and load a Vivado reference design.

Each reference design has a Tcl-script (`setup.tcl`) which allows the design to be recreated.  The script will:

* Create the project
* Add source RTL files to the project
* Generate IP (if applicable)
* Generate IPI block design (if applicable)


## Instructions

Use the steps below to load and recreate a reference design.

**NOTE:** Prior to running the script, ensure you have folder read/write access.

1. Open Vivado (either GUI or Tcl mode)
   * If opening the GUI, enter CTRL+Shift+T to open the Tcl console window
2. From within the Vivado Tcl command line, change directory to the **Vivado_Project** of the specific reference design to be loaded.

```bash
cd ./<reference_design_name>/Vivado_Project/
```

3. Run the following Tcl script from within the Vivado Tcl command line to create and load the design:

```bash
source ./setup.tcl
```

4. A directory with all the project files will be created in:

```bash
./<reference_design_name>/Vivado_Project/<project_name>
```

Once the script is complete, the following message will be displayed:

```bash
# ------------------------------------------------------
#
# Setup Complete...
#
# ------------------------------------------------------
```

Synthesis and implementation can be run through the GUI or Tcl command line.
