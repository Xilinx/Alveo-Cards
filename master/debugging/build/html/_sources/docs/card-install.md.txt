## You Will Need

For card installation, you will need to:

- Have [Root/sudo permissions](common-steps.html#root-sudo-access)
- Confirm [System compatibility](check-system-compatibility.md)
- Confirm proper airflow, these requirements are located in the respective Alveo Data Sheets from the [Alveo landing page](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo.html)

## Common Cases

### Installing a passive card into a workstation

- This is not supported.
- Passive cards are only supported in servers.

**WARNING:** Workstations do not provide enough airflow to cool passive cards. It is easy to damage passive cards in a workstation.

---

### Card used in Vivado flow

- This debug guide is for Vitis flow only.
- See the [Alveo-Vivado page](https://www.xilinx.com/member/alveo-vivado.html) for Vivado™ related content.

---

### Error message during install

- Resolve by noting the error and:
  - Checking the [Card not recognized](card-not-recognized.md) section if `lspci` is not recognizing the card
  - Checking the [Package manager](package-manager.md) section if there is an issue while installing the debs or rpms
  - Searching the [Xilinx forums](https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Alveo-Accelerator-Cards/bd-p/alveo) for a similar issue

---

### PCIe slot provides <75W power

- This configuration is not tested by Xilinx. This is not supported.

---

### Card requires PCIe AUX power but not supplied by the host

- This configuration is not tested by Xilinx. This is not supported.

---

### More cards than in-spec slots

- Limit the number of cards you will install.

---

### Card operates for a while, then shuts down

- Ensure adequate air flow.  See [Card not recognized during operation](card-not-recognized.html#card-not-recognized-during-operation)
- For operating conditions, including airflow requirements, reference the respective Alveo Data Sheets within the [Alveo landing page](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo.html).
