# Card Validation

XRT provides the `xbutil` utility which validates [card installation](card-install.md) using the `xbutil validate` command. It checks proper power connection, PCIe connection, SC version, as well as running bandwidth tests. Full details on this command can be found in the [Vitis Documentation](https://www.xilinx.com/html_docs/xilinx2020_2/vitis_doc/xbutilutility.html#fpx1536961754904). If validation fails, indicated by `ERROR: Some cards failed to validate.` the errors need to be addressed before the card can be used.

## This Page Covers

This page covers issues encountered when using `xbutil validate`. If your issue is not covered, please post on the [Xilinx forums](https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Alveo-Accelerator-Cards/bd-p/alveo).

## You Will Need

Before beginning debug, you need to:

- Ensure the card, XRT, and the deployment packages are installed as part of the [card install](card-install.md)
- Check that the [platform and SC version on the card match the platform and SC version on the system](common-steps.html#determine-platform-and-sc-on-card-and-system)
- Determine any failure mode(s) from running `xbutil validate`

## Common Cases

### Loading verify kernel error

If `[XRT] ERROR: Xclbin on card is in use` or `ERROR: XMC is not ready` is seen when running `xbutil validate`, there may be a SC issue or a driver disconnect.

### Memory bandwidth test fails

 Before XRT 2020.1 PU1, `xbutil validate` depended on Python 2.7 and support packages. If you observe errors with a `.py` file, `pyopenCL`, or `numpy` as shown below, there is an issue with those packages.

```
 xbutil validate
INFO: Validating card[0]: xilinx_u200_xdma_201830_2
....
INFO: == DMA test PASSED
INFO: == Starting device memory bandwidth test:

    import pyopencl._cl as _cl
ImportError: ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to import

ERROR: == device memory bandwidth test FAILED
INFO: Card[0] failed to validate.

ERROR: Some cards failed to validate.

```

or

```

 ERROR: Some cards failed to validate.
```

This could be due to modules being out of date, incompatible versions installed, multiple versions of python or modules exist, or required modules (such as setuptools or numpy) missing. XRT releases now use python3 without needing numpy or pyopencl.

Next steps:

- Upgrade to XRT version 2020.1_pu1 or later by following [XRT update directions](modifying-xrt-platform.html#installing-an-xrt-update)
- Or go to [AR 75294](https://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/75294.html)

### Hangs at start of validate test

If `xbutil validate` output has paused at `INFO: == Starting verify kernel test:` for more than a minute and the test is not displaying any progress, the kernel was not successfully loaded and the `xbutil validate` has hung.

Example Output:

```
xbutil validate
INFO: Validating card[0]: xilinx_u280_xdma_201920_3
INFO: == Starting AUX power connector check:
AUX power connector not available. Skipping validation
INFO: == AUX power connector check SKIPPED
INFO: == Starting PCIE link check:
INFO: == PCIE link check PASSED
INFO: == Starting SC firmware version check:
INFO: == SC firmware version check PASSED
INFO: == Starting verify kernel test:

```

Next step:

- Follow the steps in [Loading verify kernel error](card-validation.html#loading-verify-kernel-error)

---

### Loading bandwidth kernel error

 If you observere `ERROR: Failed to download xclbin:` when running `xbutil validate`, it means XRT can not program the FGPA with the kernel needed for the test.

```
INFO: == DMA test PASSED
INFO: == Starting device memory bandwidth test:
ERROR: Failed to download xclbin: bandwidth.xclbin
ERROR: == device memory bandwidth test FAILED
INFO: Card[0] failed to validate.

ERROR: Some cards failed to validate.
 ```

Next step:

- Follow the steps in [Loading verify kernel error](card-validation.html#loading-verify-kernel-error)

---

### Verify kernel test skipped

For DFX-2RP platforms such as u250_gen3x16_base_3, `xbutil validate` command will display the message `INFO: == verify kernel test SKIPPED`, as shown below, if the shell partition has not been first been loaded.  For DFX-2RP platforms, the base partition needs to be flashed and the shell needs to be loaded prior to running an application, including the `xbutil validate` application.

```
 xbutil validate
INFO: Found 1 cards

INFO: Validating card[0]: xilinx_u250_gen3x16_base_3
INFO: == Starting Kernel version check:
INFO: == Kernel version check PASSED
INFO: == Starting AUX power connector check:
INFO: == AUX power connector check PASSED
INFO: == Starting Power warning check:
INFO: == Power warning check PASSED
INFO: == Starting PCIE link check:
INFO: == PCIE link check PASSED
INFO: == Starting SC firmware version check:
INFO: == SC firmware version check PASSED
INFO: == Starting verify kernel test:
Verify xclbin not available. Skipping validation.
INFO: == verify kernel test SKIPPED
INFO: Card[0] validated successfully.
 ```

Next step:

- Load the shell partition before running an application.  See [AR 75975](https://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/75975.html) details.

---

### Different python versions for user and root

In some cases, you may have different python versions for user and for root, as shown below.  This can lead to odd behaviors with the driver.

```
~]$ python --version
Python 2.7.5
~]$ sudo python --version
Python 3.6.2
 ```

Next steps:

- Reconcile your python environment or
- Use `sudo su` to become root before running card commands

---

### PCIe link check PASSED with warning

If you encounter `PCIE link check PASSED with warning` or `Device trained to lower spec` when running `xbutil validate`, XRT is encountering a PCIe link running slower than the platform limit. Examples of these warnings are shown below.

```
...
INFO: == Starting PCIE link check:
LINK ACTIVE, ATTENTION
Ensure Card is plugged in to Gen3x16, instead of Gen3x8
Lower performance may be experienced
WARN: == PCIE link check PASSED with warning
INFO: == Starting SC firmware version check...
```

```
$ INFO: Validating device[0]:
INFO: Checking PCIE link
status: FAILED WARNING: Device trained to lower spec. Expect:
Gen3x16, Current: Gen2x16
```

Next steps:

- Ensure that the card is in a slot that supports the PCIe link speed, follow the [Determine PCIe slot type and speed](common-steps.html#determine-pcie-slot-type-and-speed) step
- If the card is in a full speed slot:
  - Reseat the card, in a different slot if possible
  - Reboot the server
  - Run `xbutil validate`
  - If issues persist go to next step
- BIOS may be limiting link speed

There are typically BIOS settings to control PCIe Generation (aka link speed). Many BIOSes support limiting a a card to PCIe Gen 1, Gen 2, or Gen 3. The menu structure differs from vendor to vendor and may differ between servers and workstations. Please refer to the manufacturer's documentation for information on your BIOS settings.

- Go into the BIOS and confirm link speed is PCIe Gen3 or higher
  - If the BIOS needed changes, cold boot and confirm link speed

---

### SC firmware mismatch error

The platform installed on the host has a different SC firmware version than installed on the card.

```
xbutil validate
INFO: Validating card[0]: xilinx_u200_xdma_201830_2
INFO: == Starting AUX power connector check:
INFO: == AUX power connector check PASSED
INFO: == Starting PCIE link check:
INFO: == PCIE link check PASSED
INFO: == Starting SC firmware version check:
SC FIRMWARE MISMATCH, ATTENTION
SC firmware running on board: 1.8. Expected SC firmware from installed Shell: 4.2.0
Please use "xbmgmt flash --scan" to check installed Shell.
WARN: == SC firmware version check PASSED with warning
.....
```

Next steps:

- Use `sudo xbmgmt flash --scan` to check the SC version on the system vs on the card
- [Flash the card with the deployment platform](common-steps.html#flash-the-card-with-a-deployment-platform) a second time to update the card's SC version to match the system

---

### AUX power not connected error

For cards supporting >75W power, `xbutil validate` will display the following warning if the PCIe AUX power is not connected or not delivering power.  Cards such as the U200/U250/U280 require the PCIe AUX power connected when running applications in the Vitis™ flow.

Example of intial output after running `xbutil validate`.

```
 ~]$ xbutil validate
INFO: Found 1 cards
INFO: Validating card[0]: xilinx_u280_xdma_201920_3
INFO: == Starting Kernel version check:
INFO: == Kernel version check PASSED
INFO: == Starting AUX power connector check:
AUX POWER NOT CONNECTED, ATTENTION
Board not stable for heavy acceleration tasks.
WARN: == AUX power connector check PASSED with warning
.....
```

Next steps:

- Confirm AUX power cable is hooked up
  - Shut down system
  - [Pull power](terminology.html#shutdown-and-unplug-pull-power)
  - Check for the presence of an AUX power cable at the card
    - UG1301 Figures 4 and 5 show the location of the AUX power connector on card
    - If there is no cable, find an 8-pin cable and check the server connection
  - If cable is present
    - Remove the cable from card
    - Confirm it is an 8 pin PCIe AUX power connector
    - Reseat cable
    - Confirm there is a good connection at the motherboard side
  - Close up the system
  - Reboot
  - Confirm power is good by running the following command
  `xbutil validate -d <card BDF>`
  - If power is not seen move to next step:

- Look at the card power sensor values

The card has built in voltage and current sensors, to display the output from these sensors, use `xbutil query`.

- 12V AUX should show a value of 12000 +/- 5%
  - The range is 11400 → 12600
- If AUX power is within range, re-run `xbutil validate`
- If AUX power is not within range double check cable seating
- If the 12V PEX or 12V AUX voltages are 0 there is a communication issue between the SC and CMC, go to [SC troubleshooting](sc-troubleshooting.md)

The following show `xbutil query` outputs for card with and without AUX power connected.

`xbutil query` output for card with AUX power connected

```
Electrical(mV|mA)
12V PEX         12V AUX         12V PEX Current 12V AUX Current
12107           12103           1579            1414
```

`xbutil query` output for card without AUX power connected

```
Electrical(mV|mA)
12V PEX         12V AUX         12V PEX Current 12V AUX Current
12384           450             1636            20
```
