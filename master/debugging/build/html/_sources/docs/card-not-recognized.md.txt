# Card Not Recognized

When Alveo™ card(s) are installed and functioning correctly within a host machine, the `lspci` Linux command will correctly identify and report their details as shown in the example below.

```
:~> sudo lspci -vd 10ee:
03:00.0 Processing accelerators: Xilinx Corporation Device 5004
        Subsystem: Xilinx Corporation Device 000e
        Physical Slot: 4
        Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, NUMA node 0
        Memory at d2000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=32M]
        Memory at d4000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=128K]
        Capabilities: [40] Power Management version 3
        Capabilities: [60] MSI-X: Enable+ Count=33 Masked-
        Capabilities: [70] Express Endpoint, MSI 00
        Capabilities: [100] Advanced Error Reporting
        Capabilities: [1c0] #19
        Capabilities: [400] Access Control Services
        Capabilities: [410] #15
        Kernel driver in use: xclmgmt
        Kernel modules: xclmgmt
```

However, there are times when the card is not recognized by the host OS and `lspci` does not list the card. This section covers techniques to determine the root cause. If you are just starting to debug, please consult the [main page](../README.md) to determine if this is the best page for your purposes.

## This Page Covers

This page details scenarios and recommended steps to take when the card is not recognized by the host. If your issue is not covered, please post on the [Xilinx forums](https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Alveo-Accelerator-Cards/bd-p/alveo).

Typical causes can be grouped into card and host based issues as given below:

- Card based
  - Poorly seated card
  - [USB cable plugged into a U200/U250/U280](#usb-cable-plugged-into-card)
  - Card operated out of spec
- Host based
  - Bad or incompatible motherboard slot
  - Slot disabled by host
    - A missing CPU can cause this
  - Poorly seated server risers
  - Other hardware added to the system
  - BIOS settings

## You Will Need

Before beginning debug, you need to:

- Have [Root/sudo permissions](common-steps.html#root-sudo-access)

## Common Cases

### Card not recognized under `lspci`

This is a large problem space that can have many potential causes. To narrow likely causes we need to consider both the host machine and the card.

#### Host machine

- [Check system compatibility](check-system-compatibility.md)
- If the card is in the system, try a warm boot.
  - If this fixes the issue, see [Card recognized after warm boot](#card-recognized-after-a-warm-boot)
- [Check for unpopulated CPU sockets](common-steps.html#check-for-unpopulated-cpus)
  - The PCIe controller is built into modern CPUs. If there are one or more missing CPUs you may not be able to use all the PCIe slots, review system documentation to determine which slots are usable.

#### Alveo card

Go through the following scenarios and see if they apply:

- [USB cable is plugged in](#usb-cable-plugged-into-card)
- [Card is not recognized after using Vivado flow](#vivado-flow)
- [Card is not recognized after programming a shell or reverting to golden image](#card-not-recognized-after-loading-platform-or-golden-image)
- [Card recognized at first but not after the machine has been on for a while or while in use](#card-not-recognized-during-operation)

If the above scenarios don't apply, test the card/machine for the following:

- Test the card in another slot in the same machine. If this works, go to [the card is recognized in a another slot in the same machine](#card-is-recognized-in-different-pcie-slot-in-same-machine)
- Test the card in another machine (if possible, one where other Alveo cards have worked). If the card works, then go to [the card works in a another machine](#card-is-recognized-in-another-machine)
- If another card is available, test in the same slot. If the alternate card is recognized, go to [a second Alveo card is recognized in the same slot](#different-alveo-card-is-recognized-in-same-slot)

If none of the above have narrowed down the potential issue:

- [Check the BIOS bifurcation settings](#pcie-bifurcation-setting)
- Look at the LEDs on the card:
  - [Card's blue LED not illuminated](#blue-led-not-illuminated)
  - [Card's red LED is illuminated](#red-led-illuminated)

As a last attempt:

- Cold boot the system twice
- [Pull power](terminology.html#shutdown-and-unplug-pull-power)
- Reseat the Alveo card
- Reseat the server risers if applicable
- Bring system back up
- Check to see if the card is recognized

If the issue hasn't been addressed, please post your situation and the steps that you have gone through to the [Xilinx forums](https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Alveo-Accelerator-Cards/bd-p/alveo).

### Vivado flow

This guide does not cover Vivado™ flow debug.

Next steps:

- You can revert to golden using [AR 71757](https://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/71757.html) to go back to a Vitis™ flow
- Search for answers on the
[Xilinx forums](https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Alveo-Accelerator-Cards/bd-p/alveo)

---

### USB cable plugged into card

For cards with a USB port, including U200, U250 and U280, ensure there is no USB cable plugged into the card as it will block the FPGA from enumerating on the PCIe bus.

Next steps:

- Unplug USB cable
- Cold boot the system

---

### Card recognized after a warm boot

If `lspci` does not recognize the Alveo card after the machine first powers on, one of the first tests is to perform a warm reboot. If the card is recognized after a warm reboot, this may suggest that there is a BIOS issue.

Before warmboot `lspci` does not recognize the installed card.

```
:~> sudo lspci -vd 10ee:
:~>
```

After warmboot, the same `lspci` command recognizes the installed card.

```
:~> sudo lspci -vd 10ee:
03:00.0 Processing accelerators: Xilinx Corporation Device 5004
        Subsystem: Xilinx Corporation Device 000e
        Physical Slot: 4
        Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, NUMA node 0
        Memory at d2000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=32M]
        Memory at d4000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=128K]
        Capabilities: [40] Power Management version 3
        Capabilities: [60] MSI-X: Enable+ Count=33 Masked-
        Capabilities: [70] Express Endpoint, MSI 00
        Capabilities: [100] Advanced Error Reporting
        Capabilities: [1c0] #19
        Capabilities: [400] Access Control Services
        Capabilities: [410] #15
        Kernel driver in use: xclmgmt
        Kernel modules: xclmgmt
```

The BIOS can start enumerating devices on the PCIe bus 100ms after the system starts to boot. Sometimes Alveo cards take longer than that to program the static region of the shell containing the PCIe core. Once programmed the card’s PCIe core remains active even during a warm boot. Since a warm boot will cause the BIOS to re-enumerate devices on the PCIe bus, if the Alveo card is recognized, it suggests the BIOS is enumerating before the Alveo card’s PCIe core is active.

Next steps:

- [Disable fastboot](common-steps.html#disable-fastboot)

---

### Card not recognized after loading platform or golden image

If the card is no longer recognized after loading a platform or reverting to the golden image, there is an issue with the host to card communication.

Next steps:

- Cold boot the computer and see if host will recognize
- Run a warmboot and see if the card is recognized
  - If so go to [Card recognized after warm boot](#card-recognized-after-a-warm-boot)
- Confirm BIOS is not in [safety mode](#bios-in-safety-mode)
- Try reseating the card and seeing if the host will recognize
- See if the FPGA is seen in [Vivado HW Manager](common-steps.html#vivado-hw-manager)
  - If it can be seen, revert the card to golden [AR 71757](https://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/71757.html)

---

### Card not recognized during operation

If the card is no longer recognized under `lspci` while the machine is on, the card may be overheating, which causes the FPGA to shutdown and be no longer recognized on the PCIe bus.

If the system does not have enough airflow it is possible the FPGA can overheat taking out the PCIe core on the FPGA.

 Next steps:

- [Check for an over temperature event in dmesg](common-steps.html#use-system-logs-to-see-if-the-card-exceeded-power-or-thermal-limits)
- Use `xbutil query` to [monitor card temperature](common-steps.html#monitor-card-power-and-temperature)
- If there is an over temperature event or if the card is over 90C in xbutil query
  - Cold boot the system
  - Increasing system airflow
    - May need to turn up fan speed
    - May need to close lid
    - May need to check for airflow blocks in system
      - Stray cables
      - Something blocking fan
- If temperatures and electrical limits are good, and the card is no longer recognized while running an application
  - Go to [Application Crash](application-crash.md)

### Card is recognized in different PCIe slot in same machine

If the card is tested and recognized in a different PCIe slot on the same machine, there is an issue with the intended motherboard slot.

Next steps:

- Ensure [PCIe slot type and speed](common-steps.html#determine-pcie-slot-type-and-speed) match the platform requirements
- [Check for unpopulated CPU sockets](common-steps.html#check-for-unpopulated-cpus)
- Review BIOS settings and see if the BIOS sees the card

---

### Card is recognized in another machine

If the card is tested and recognized in a different machine, there is an issue with the intended machine settings.

Next steps:

- Try another PCIe slot
- [Check for unpopulated CPU sockets](common-steps.html#check-for-unpopulated-cpus)
- See if the host has a [New or updated BIOS on the machine](#new-or-updated-bios-on-machine)
- Ensure [PCIe slot type and speed](common-steps.html#determine-pcie-slot-type-and-speed) match the card deployment platform requirements.
- Check airflow

---

### Different Alveo card is recognized in same slot

If a different Alveo card is tested and recognized in the same slot, there is an issue with the intended card.

Next steps:

- Confirm card hasn't been used in [Vivado flow](#vivado-flow)
- Look at the LEDs on the card:
  - [Card's blue LED not illuminated](#blue-led-not-illuminated)
  - [Card's red LED is illuminated](#red-led-illuminated)
- See if the FPGA is seen in [Vivado HW Manager](common-steps.html#vivado-hw-manager)
  - If it can be seen, revert the card to golden [AR 71757](https://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/71757.html)
- If the card isn't visible in the Vivado HW Manager navigate to the [Service Portal](https://www.xilinx.com/support.html) and initiate a return request.

---

### PCIe bifurcation setting

PCIe bifurcation splits the PCIe link into two (or more) smaller buses. The bifurcation setting can be found in the BIOS. Not all systems support bifurcation.
Alveo platforms detailed in this guide are expecting a non-bifurcated link.  Ensure bifurcation is not enabled.

Next step:

- Refer to manufacture's BIOS documentation to turn off bifurcation.
