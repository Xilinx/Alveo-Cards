# XRT 2021.1 Command Updates
In the 2021.1 version of XRT, there are new default subcommands for the xbmgmt and xbutil tools. Both the new and the legacy subcommands work in this release. The new commands are the future and we encourage migration.

For full details on the updated commands, please see the XRT documentation:
- [Next generation xbutil](https://xilinx.github.io/XRT/master/html/xbutil2.html)
- [Next generation xbmgmt](https://xilinx.github.io/XRT/master/html/xbmgmt2.html)
- [Map from legacy commands to next generation commands](https://xilinx.github.io/XRT/master/html/xbtools_map.html)

IMPORTANT NOTE: The Alveo Debug Guide uses the legacy commands and example outputs. It has not yet been updated for the 2021.1 commands. There are plans to update the guide with the new XRT commands/outputs in the future.


If you are using the 2021.1 version of XRT but would like to run a legacy command outlined in this guide, either use the old syntax, or force the old behavior with the `--legacy` switch as part of the command.
