Introduction
------------
    This specification describes the detailed design and layout of field
    replaceable unit (FRU) content for each unit stored in the EEPROM
    and used by all Xilinx\ :sup:`®` Alveo™ cards to facilitate its
    implmentation. The FRU information is primarily used to provide
    *inventory* information about where the FRU information device is
    located. All major field replaceable units should have an EEPROM
    that includes, at a minimum, the serial number, part number,
    manufacturer information, version number, and can be read through
    software.

    ***Note*:** This FRU specification follows the `Intelligent Platform
    Management Interface FRU
    Specification <https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/specification-updates/ipmi-platform-mgt-fru-info-storage-def-v1-0-rev-1-3-spec-update.pdf>`__.
