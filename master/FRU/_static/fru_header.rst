FRU Common Header
-----------------

The common header section is mandatory for all Alveoâ„¢ Products. This section holds version information for the overall format specification, including offsets to the other area, as shown in the following table. The other areas can be present based on the application of the device. An area is inferred as *null* or *not present* when the common header has a value of 00h for the starting offset of that area.
