# QSFP I2C Reference Design: Simulation

## Running the Simulation

To run a simulation of the design, follow the instructions detailed [here](../../Docs/simulating_a_design.md).

## QSFP I2C Power Plane Enable Simulation Behavior

After the waveform window is done loading, click the Run All button. The waveform should run for approximately 1.5ms. At this time, a test complete message will appear in the log window. The waveform window should look like this, consisting of three I2C transfers.
