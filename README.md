## [Debug Guide](https://xilinx.github.io/Alveo-Cards/master/debugging/README.html)


Quickly isolate, debug, and resolve a wide range of issues within the Vitis/XRT flow, from card installation through hardware validation.




## [Out-of-Band Management Specification](https://xilinx.github.io/Alveo-Cards/master/management-specification/index.html)



Describes out-of-band (OoB) support available for the U200, U250, U280, U50x, U30 and U55x Alveo data center cards. Out-of-band support is implemented in the Satellite Controller (SC) firmware, which supports communication with the server Board Management Controller (BMC) over the SMBus/I2C interface on the PCIe® edge connector. The underlying protocols supported are standard I2C protocol and PLDM Over MCTP Over SMBus.



## [Field Replaceable Unit (FRU) Specification](https://xilinx.github.io/Alveo-Cards/master/FRU/index.html)



This specification describes the detailed design and layout of field replaceable unit (FRU) content supported in all Xilinx Alveo™ cards. The FRU information is primarily used to provide inventory information. All major field replaceable units should have an EEPROM that includes, at a minimum, the serial number, part number, manufacturer information, version number, and can be read through software. The FRU specification is supported by the U200, U250, U280, U50x, U30 and U55x Alveo™ Data Center Cards.
